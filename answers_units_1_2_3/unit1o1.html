    <h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business  </h2>
    Companies rely on IT for handling large amounts of data quickly, communication and market research to gain an accurate view of their business as well as the market. This aides in decision making both in respects to the handling of a business to the types of markets a company is in.
    Collaborative technologies allow teams to work on different areas of the same product at the same time, no matter where they are located.
    Enterprise resource planning systems allow managers to review sales, costs and other operating metrics in real time. These allow managers to make changes and suggestions to products quickly.
    IT plays an integral role in every industry, helping companies improve business processes, achieve cost efficiencies, drive revenue growth and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.</div>
    
    <br><div class = "box box9"><h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?  </h2>
    to complete digital projects successfully you need to be able to plan effectively and have good sense of the work required. Creating a project that is outside of your range of skill should be done with extreme caution as it may turn out that something critical to your project is unfeasible for you to complete.
    you will need good attention to detail to catch mistakes quickly as a small error may make your code for a certain area of your project unworkable.
    you will also need to have a good work ethic. Depending on the size of a project, it may take days to months to complete and suffering from 'burnout' is a real consideration that should be taken into account
    resources needed can range from assets found in your application of choice, to libraries found built into your coding software. I would also consider being able to search online for general solution to problems a very valuable skill, as you may run into problems that you and your team members are not sure of.</div>
    <br><div class = "box box8"><h2>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.  </h2>
    Planning is an important part of making any digital project. To plan this project, every process has been separated into a different activity, put into a Trello board. As I make progress on each task, each can be from the ‘not started’ to the ‘doing’ section, and once completed, it can be moved in the ‘done’ section. Bleow is a link to the trello board I used</div>
    <br><div class = "box box7"><h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?  </h2>
    There are several risks that you should be aware of when attempting a digital project both during the planning phase and during the production. It may appear that when planning a project, that a simple idea becomes more complicated and unworkable. If this kind of road block appears, you wither have to rework your plan to get around the issue, or to spend an undetermined amount of time looking for resources online for a solution.
    If your computer crashes as your coding, you would lose any progress that is not saved. a crash cannot be planned around, and you will always lose some work, but you can back up your work as you go, to keep this lose to a minimum</div>
    <br><div class = "box box6"><h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?  </h2>
    The technologies used for the previous collaborative , python to write code, google hangout for Stand-ups each morning and evening, a group Trello board and slack to share files.</div>
    <br><div class = "box box5"><h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>
    
    A big factor in deciding which resources you can use, your budget will be a big factor. 
    This a curated list of all the assets available for creating a project in unity, an application used for making interactive games. Other programmes would have a different list of assets available
    However, the resources are very limited when compared to paid assets and plugins you can use if you paid a licensing fee. Which programme or programmes you use for you project will depend on how much of a budget you have available to you, and what assets are available on different platforms.

    <br><div class = "box box4"><h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
    
    The general data protection regulation (GDPR) from the EU is a regulation to give EU citizens greater control over their personal data and assurances that their personal information is protected. Personal data ranges from personal details and bank details, to user’s IP addresses and location details. This regulation gives uses the right to know what data companies have on them, the right to be informed before data is collected and the right to request that their data is updated. Individual can also have their information corrected, the right to deny processing of data and the right to be ‘forgotten’ once they are no longer customers
    Any digital project that handles user data must comply with these regulations and include features for all of the above for the users.
