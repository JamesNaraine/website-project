    <h2>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page </h2>
    The website will have a list of pretentious but ultimately rubbish quotes that people have posted on twitter. have a home page with a scrollable list of quotes and a 'random' button. Have an 'about me' section and a 'contact me' page
    </div>
    <br><div class = "box box1"><h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
    most of the content will either be image macros or quoted text. If published =, there could be some quotes which fall under copyright and won't be allowed to be published.
    most will be quotes from twitter, which should not fall under copyright. however there are some quotes that come from books which would fall under copyright
    to avoid legal trouble I will have a contact me page, which will let anyone who complain about a quote, and I can take it down if necessary
    </div>  
    <br><div class = "box box10"><h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them  </h2>
    There are people who have different kinds of colour-blindness. Deuteranomaly is the most common kind of red-green colour blindness. There is also Tritanomaly which is blue-green colour blindness and Tritanopia which makes it difficult to see the difference between blue and green, purple and red, and yellow and pink.
    for these users, it would be useful to have a black and white option so there can view the site normally.

    <br><div class = "box box9"><h2>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
    <p>There are various file types that can be used on your website depend on what your website is for.</p>

    <p>Executable files ( .EXE) are used If the user can download a program that needs to be installed. Graphics Interchange Format (.gif) is the most common image format on the Internet and is a 'moving picture'. </p>

    <p>Most pages you create for a website will be a hyperText markup Language files (.HTML/ .HTM). Since HTM files are text-only files, they just contain text, as well as text references to other external files (like the image in this article). there are other files that may appear on your website.</p>

    <p>The Joint Photographic Experts Group file (.JPG/ .JPEG) is another very common image file format, mainly used for photos. Portable Network Graphics (.PNG) are a file format designed to be used in place of GIFs. They are usually slightly smaller, and sport advanced features like 24-bit colour support. </p>

    <p>Musical Instrument Digital Interface (.MIDI/ .MID) are midis are sequenced music files made on keyboards. Theyâ€™re usually really small and are often simple music notes in an specific order. MPEG Layer 3 sound file (.MP3) is a sound file format which is highly compressed, allowing for music files to be more complicated than .MIDI files.</p>

    <p>Motion Picture Experts Group file (.MPEG/ .MPG) is One of the standards for streaming video with sounds. often used for movies and the like. The QuickTime format (.MOV/ .QT) is similar but was designed by Apple and originated on the Mac, but has made the transition to the PC.</p>

    <p>Portable Document Format (.PDF) were invented so that documents could be transferred between computers and indeed platforms, and still look the exact same.</p>

    <p>Zipped files (.zip) are really groups of other types of files kept together and compressed a bit. Many downloads will consist of zip collections. RAR archive (.RAR) is a compressed file format similar to the popular .zip format, with a few more features. Text (.TXT) are simple text documents that can be shared online. the wave sound file (.wav) is a simple sound file. you may need an additional programme to view .wav files.</p>
