        <div class = "box box10"> hi. I recently became very interested in programming and I made this page as part of a larger course I completed in a programming course hosted by Digital Academy. This site is not meant to be taken as a serious critique of any content feature here and was purely made to show how far I’ve come as a programmer.
    If you would like to contact me about the site or any of the content on the site, please contact me @[email address] and I will be happy to resolve any queries you might have. ‘ </p>
