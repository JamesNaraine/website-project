    <h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello  </h2>
    Visual code was relatively easy to use and there were many online tutorials that helped me with when I ran into problems. 
    Trello was useful as it allowed me to organise what’s parts of this project needed doing in an easily understandable way. Once different sections were completed, different parts could be moved around the Trello board and it was always very clear which parts needed more attention.

    <br><div class = "box box9"><h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello  </h2>
    Trello is very useful when you are in a team of people because each person could move different sections around as they completed them in real time and it was always available to everyone in the group. As this was a solo project, this functionality was redundant, because I was the only one who needed to see the board and as it was a simple project, there was no need to have a Trello board.
    Visual studio has a few very useful features that make coding a lot less stressful. Visual studio will automatically fill out some blocks of text which it thinks will be needed. For instance, if your type’<div>’ it will automatically add ‘</div>’ as that is what you will type to close the divider. All in all, sometimes this text is not needed, but more often than not it will save you time overall.

    <br><div class = "box box8"><h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?</h2>
    I am happy with the final product of the website. Even though I’m happy with the result, There are certainly changes I would make in the making process. It would probably be easier to have the majority of the content I wanted on the site in a separate file ready before I started making the website its self. Going back and adding and trimming away caused many problems as sometimes I would accidentally remove something and not realise until a while later. It would be unreasonable to have all the content ready to go. But I would be much happier if there was a large portion of the content ready.

    <br><div class = "box box7"><h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project  </h2>
    This design of the website is somewhat bland. If I have more time, I would put a lot more time into the layout and aesthetics of the website. 
    </div>
    <br><div class = "box box6"><h2> Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose </h2> 
    I wanted a website which had a couple of choice quotes I found online with some commentary. I have the quotes, but there is no random quote button that I wanted. After trying multiple times, I simply couldn’t get it to function the way I wanted.
