    <h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?  </h2>
    There are many ways to make a process such as the making of a website more efficiently. There are several problems which I had run into which could have been easily avoided if I had more experience. By doing more of these projects, running into these kind of problems will become more infrequent.</p>
    <p>The Trello board seems to add more time to any project and for large projects it can be justifiable. However, all the advantages of Trello are somewaht limited in a solo project. Theres no need for a live updating system, because there is only one person changing it and reviewing it.  </p>
    <p> Please click here<a href="https://trello.com/invite/b/eyBwqZpG/9e0ce7bc86a12d74795856e52adc09e5/website-project"> here</a> for a link to my Trelo board.</p></div>
    <br><div class = "box box4"><h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency  </h2>
    <p>There are only so many hours in the day, so making the most of your time is critical. There are two ways increase your output--either put in more hours or work smarter. It sounds counterintuitive, but taking scheduled breaks can actually help improve concentration. Some research has shown that taking short breaks during long tasks helps you to maintain a constant level of performance; while working at a task without breaks leads to a steady decline in performance.</p>
    <p>For open-ended tasks or projects, giving yourself a deadline, and then sticking to it can help</p>
    <p>While we tend to think of the ability to multitask as an important skill for increasing efficiency, the opposite may in fact be true. Psychologists have found attempting to do several tasks at once can result in lost time and productivity. Instead, make a habit of committing to a single task before moving on to your next project.</p>
    <p>It's common for entrepreneurs to get hung up on attempting to perfect a task--the reality is nothing is ever perfect. Rather than wasting time chasing after this illusion, bang out your task to the best of your ability and move on.</p>

    <br><div class = "box box3"><h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?  </h2>
    <p>Allowing incoming phone calls and emails to dictate how you spend your day will mean you do a great job of putting out fires--but that may be all you get accomplished. My friend and business partner Peter Daisyme from free hosting company Host says, "Set aside time for responding to emails, but don't let them determine what your day is going to look like. Have a plan of attack at the start of each day, and then do your best to stick to it."</p>
    <p>No one can be expected to resist the allure of an email, voicemail, or text notification. During work hours, turn off your notifications, and instead build in time to check email and messages. </p>
    <p>Having a colleague pop their head into your office to chat may seem innocuous, but even brief interruptions appear to produce a change in work pattern and a corresponding drop in productivity. Minimizing interruptions may mean setting office hours, keeping your door closed, or working from home for time-sensitive projects.</p>
    </div>
    <br><div class = "box box2"><h2>Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions </h2>
    <p>I would run the ‘digital solution’ was and then, when it doesn’t work, I would try and fix it, and then I would test it again. I would repeat this process until the final product worked as intended.</p>
